It is a curious fact how the "Remembrance of Earth's Past" novel series manages to keep one engaged throughout the narrative. Although the 3rd Book in the series has a different Writing Style compared to those before it, there is a good balance between Story advancement and Character building. It manages to keep things fresh while at the same time building the Storyline in an enticing manner.

Central to the Book we still have the fight between Humanity and Trisolaris. However, for some unknown reason at first we realize that everything hangs in a sensitive balance: both Worlds are in a sort of stalemate where everyone keeps plotting against one another. Trisolaris learns to adapt to the mischievous nature of Humans, and they go about hiding things from them almost as an Art form. 

While Trisolaris are superior technologically in all areas, Humanity keeps them tamed because of the use of a "Dark Forest Deterrent" Strategy: without anything to lose anymore if they were invaded, they have setup three (3) failsafe means of enacting a Signal propagation that would reveal the location of both Worlds within the Dark Forest of our Galaxy. A kind of M.A.D. mechanism, as in use today, but with the added flavor of the Dark Forest Theory. Unfortunately, Trisolaris have become pretty cunning themselves and are able to coordinate a precision strike with clockwork accuracy across vast distances in Space which, at first, renders all three (3) of Humanity's means of defense useless.

We then join Humanity in a takeover exercise by the technologically superior Trisolaris beings. Our planet's members will become subjugated and exiled with extreme consequences: unfortunately many millions will die. The narrative keeps focusing on a the Main Character's fate throughout all the suffering -- we accompany them throughout their rise, their downfall to inhumane levels, and followed by perseverance to get back up in the fight. Finally, a sort of Repent phase causes them to do an unexpected plot twist.

The fight for Humanity's survival continues across a timespan of many Centuries, made possible by a key technological advancement which also reveals the meaning behind the Book's title: we will manage to cheat Death and bring the fight to the enemy by strategically employing Cryogenic Sleep. Of course, the Plot does not center on just this one aspect, however there is a clear strategic advantage by using it to advance the Storyline.

While you may think that sharing above details give away quite a bit, rest assured: the Book, while a bit of a cumbersome read at times, has plenty of episodes to keep one both entertained and informed. For sure, I have had many a chance to think through and get my head around many scientific and technological issues that Humanity is planning to make use of today and perhaps in the future. Another good example of this: I can fairly state that I now have knowledge about how Space Curvature-based propulsion and engines may work (in principle). And for sure I can go about learning more, after being intrigued by the Author. Isn't it a bit odd how one stumbles upon such complex concepts, yet one keep going wanting to learn more? Thinking this is part of the magic of Cixin Liu's legacy: a gracious science communicator, that brings the state-of-the-art closer to the day-to-day day person, which raises our curiosity and hope for a better future of Humanity.

Inviting you to give this third Book a read too, and to persist through its different Writing Style, if you have the time on your hands.
