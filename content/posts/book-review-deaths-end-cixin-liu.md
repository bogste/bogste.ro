](/posts/about-my-book-reviews#content) -- **Genre**: Science Fiction

Central to the Book is the ongoing conflict between Humanity and Trisolaris. At first we realize that everything is locked in a tense stalemate: both sides are constantly plotting against each other. Trisolaris adapts to Humanity's cunning nature, mastering the art of deception. To Humanity, it appears they have finally outmaneuvered their technologically superior enemy.

While Trisolaris maintains technological superiority, Humanity keeps them tamed by using a "Dark Forest Deterrent" Strategy: without anything to lose anymore if they were invaded, they have setup three (3) failsafe means of enacting a signal propagation that would reveal the location of both Worlds within the Dark Forest of our Galaxy. This is akin to the [M.A.D. mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction), as in use today, but with the added flavor of the [Dark Forest Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_forest_hypothesis). However, Trisolaris demonstrates their craftiness by coordinating a precision strike across vast distances in space, initially neutralizing all three of Humanity's defensive measures. We then join Humanity's struggle as a takeover exercise by the technologically superior Trisolaris beings is underway. Our planet's members will become subjugated and exiled with extreme consequences: unfortunately many millions will die. But throughout all this ordeal, the story finally settles on the main character's journey, chronicling their rise, fall to inhumane circumstances, and subsequent perseverance. A phase of repentance leads to an unexpected plot twist.

The fight for Humanity's survival spans centuries, made possible by a key technological advancement which also reveals the meaning behind the Book's title: Cryogenic Sleep. We will manage to cheat Death and bring the fight to the enemy by strategically employing a sort of Hibernation. While this isn't the sole focus of the plot, it provides a clear advantage in advancing the storyline.

Despite revealing these plot details, the book offers numerous engaging episodes that both entertain and inform. The author continues his mission to present complex scientific and technological concepts in an accessible manner, encouraging readers to explore further. For instance, the novel provides insights into theoretical space propulsion methods, such as Space Curvature-based engines. This blend of hard science with fiction and engaging storytelling is part of Cixin Liu's legacy as a skilled Science communicator, bringing cutting-edge concepts to the average reader and inspiring curiosity about Humanity's future.

Worth noting that the third book's different writing style may require some persistence, but it's well worth the effort for readers who have the time to invest. While occasionally cumbersome, the narrative rewards patience with its thought-provoking ideas and grand scope.

In conclusion, this final installment of the "Remembrance of Earth's Past" series seemingly offers a satisfying closure to the epic saga. It challenges readers with complex concepts while maintaining an engaging plot, cementing Cixin Liu's reputation as a master of hard science fiction. For those who have followed the series thus far, this book is a must-read, providing a fitting end to an ambitious and intellectually stimulating trilogy. But is it [really at an end](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36262251-the-redemption-of-time)?

Happy lecture diving!

### Noteworthy Quotes

{{< quote layout="icon-blockquote" >}}
Yang Dong was not really in the mood to discuss such matters, but the moment Green Glasses unchecked the option for life in the configuration panel, a thought had flashed into her mind. 

She asked the next terrifying question: “What about the universe?” 

“The universe?” 

“If we use a similar mathematical model to simulate the entire universe, and uncheck the option for life at the beginning, what would the resulting universe look like?”

She tried to respond with a smile of her own, but the first words out of Wade’s mouth froze her face and entire body. “Would you sell your mother to a whorehouse?” Cheng Xin shook her head no, but she wasn’t even trying to respond to the question; she was terrified that she had not understood what he said.

{{< quote layout="icon-blockquote" >}}
“What if he killed millions? I can guarantee you such a person would not be considered a murderer. Indeed, such a person may not even be thought to have broken any law. If you don’t believe me, just study history! Anyone who has killed millions is deemed a ‘great’ man, a hero.

“And if that person destroyed a whole world and killed every life on it—he would be hailed as a savior!”

{{< quote layout="icon-blockquote" >}}
Historically, inequality mainly manifested itself in areas like economics or social status, but death basically treated everyone the same. To be sure, such equality wasn’t absolute: For instance, access to medical care wasn’t evenly distributed; the wealthy fared better in natural disasters than the poor; soldiers and civilians had different rates of survival in war; and so on. But never before had a situation like this presented itself: less than one-ten-thousandth of the population could go into safe hiding, leaving billions on Earth to die.
