A good while back, even before considering posting anything, I thought hard about the types of content that this space would hold. Among them were *Book Reviews*.

This one is about how I grade any Books that I will have the chance of spending any time with.

 *“The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.”*

The idea of a structured approach for this came into mind a while back and only after serious thought and a bit of [inspiration](https://anaulin.org/blog/my-book-ratings/) (the latter of which credits must go to [Ana Ulin](https://social.coop/@anaulin)), I was able to come up with one that suited my needs.

Adopting a correct system for [reading books](https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/) is as important as having a follow-up system for efficiently [remembering what you read](https://fs.blog/2021/08/remember-books/).

Nevertheless a good book, whether from Fiction genre or others, should steadily build-up the opportunity of teaching you *something*. Moreover, in my experience Books whose Authors manage to 'connect' with the Reader in a relatable, humane and kind way will leave the most impact.

So if you see anything labelled with *'Book Review'* around this space, do know that it tries to abide by what is described below. Generally, they may include a rating, a (referral) link to (buy) it, my opinion on the Author, the Context and any favorite passages or Quotes extracted from it.

Without further delay, here is how I categorize any Books I come upon:


| My Rating | What it means...                                        |
