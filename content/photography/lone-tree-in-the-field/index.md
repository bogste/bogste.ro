It all started with a drive over to Tismana region, of Gorj county, in Romania.

After passing through Peștișani, as driving towards Tismana from Târgu-Jiu, on the left a wide field opens up; bordered further, on the same side, by a throng of trees. Even further up ahead, about 2 Km, there is a large forest coming up. However, before the main road dives into the forest, there is a moderate-to-large sized Field and in it I noticed that a *Lone Tree* goes about its usual life.

Returning later during Sunset one evening, in early August, I took a few shots of it. Of all my attempts, this is what came out as a selection to start my editing work on:

Using Skylum's [Luminar AI](https://skylum.grsm.io/bogste) I have tried to add more to the weight to their simplicity, by playing with colours and light. These are the results I was most happy with at the time:

Later on, I tried going a little further by putting [Luminar's AI](https://skylum.grsm.io/bogste) at work and yielding these dramatic (albeit fake) results.

Neat, right?

If you would like to take some shots of your own, *Lone Tree*'s location can be found on [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/yCh7fT6rcTtfdfb27) or via these GPS coordinates `45°03'50.9"N 23°01'16.2"E`. Happy photo shooting!
