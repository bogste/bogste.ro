Hi there :wave:,

My *Pen name* is Ian Bog'Ste.

You'll have to know that I am a seasoned Software Development / Engineering Manager, having a strong Customer focus, with over 10 years of experience building Cloud Web and Enterprise-scale Applications in cross-industry (Financial Services, Retail, Automotive, Manufacturing and Public Sector) landscapes.

Recently, I have passionately engaged in:
 - i.) developing the [Cloud Managed Services](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/consulting/solutions/cloud-managed-services.html) Market Offering for my Employer,

 - iii.) oversaw and supported AWS (EKS), Azure (AKS) (Managed Kubernetes) and Microservices deployments part of [a state-of-the-art Internet Banking Accelerator](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/financial-services/solutions/alphaplatform.html).

Previously, I was engaged (multi-yearly) in enabling Nearshore Delivery for the same Employer, focusing on e-Commerce implementations using SAP Commerce Cloud. If youâ€™re curious about my full Work Experience, have a peek at my *Professional Experience* section below.
