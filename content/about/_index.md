Hi there :wave:,

I am Ian Bog'Ste.

You'll have to know that I am a seasoned Software Development / Engineering Manager, having a strong Customer focus, with over 10 years of experience building Cloud Web and Enterprise-scale Applications in cross-industry (Financial Services, Retail, Automotive, Manufacturing and Public Sector) landscapes.

Recently, I have passionately engaged in:
 - i.) developing a new Cloud Managed Services offering for my Employer,
 - ii.) building High-Performance Teams for Cloud Engineering, and
 - iii.) overseeing and supporting state-of-the-art AWS (EKS) and Azure (AKS) Kubernetes and Microservices deployments using [Deloitte's Alpha Platform](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/financial-services/solutions/alphaplatform.html).

Previously, I was engaged (multi-yearly) in enabling Nearshore Delivery for the same Employer, focusing on e-Commerce implementations using SAP Commerce Cloud.

Passionate about Programming, Science, Technology (in general) and everything Internet-related.


**Hobbies or other Interests**:
